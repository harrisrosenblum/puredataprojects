#X text 724 81 Granular delay pretty much takes a delay buffer and
then randomizes playback snippets with like 80 different virtual playheads
in stereo. Before you change "grain feedback" MAKE SURE THAT GRAIN
SPAN & TIME ARE BOTH NON ZERO. If you don't the sound will be just
insane glitches (like if you put a delay pedal with almost no dtime
at 500% feedback). This effect alone can be used to make weird reverb
or pitch clouds or other crazy shit. If you dont want to use it set
the first three sliders to 0 After the sound goes through the granular
delay is is then spectrally delayed in stereo. This is a really complex
process that i only understand on the surface level but essentially
imagine dividing the spectrum of human hearing into 512 evenly spaced
divisions and than putting a band pass filter on each division. Then
each of those band pass filters is delayed by a specific amount. The
result when you play a burst of noise is like a ton of raindrops at
different frequencies when the delay times are randomized. The coolest
part of this effect is the way you can dictate delay times for different
frequencies. Again really complicated but i pretty much did some math
and added parameters for you to be able to dictate how the delay tables
are set up. They are also randomizable but you can figure out whats
going on better by playing with it than by me explaining. All of this
content is then low pass filtered to whatever cutoff you choose.;
